Welcome to the Password Generator, a web app designed to generate strong and secure passwords based on user preferences! Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development, user interface design, and JavaScript for interactive functionality.

### Project Goals:

-   Create a user-friendly platform for generating secure passwords.
-   Implement customization options for password composition (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols).
-   Provide users with the ability to save and download generated passwords.
-   Design a clean, responsive UI that is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Challenges Overcome
-------------------

Throughout the development of Password Generator, I encountered a few challenges that helped enhance my skills:

-   **Password Generation Logic**: Designing an algorithm that efficiently generates secure passwords while considering various character types and length requirements.
-   **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to update the UI dynamically based on user input (e.g., real-time password generation).
-   **State Management**: Managing the state of saved passwords and ensuring the interface reflects the current data (e.g., saving and downloading passwords).
-   **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the app works seamlessly on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
